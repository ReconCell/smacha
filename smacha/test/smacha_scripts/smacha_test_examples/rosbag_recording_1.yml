# NOTE: When executing this script, in order for the PublishMsgState template to
# publish messages, it needs to be able to subscribe to the tf topic which
# should be publishing something while the script is executing. A fake tf
# publication loop can be set up using, e.g., the following command:
# $ rostopic pub -r 100 /tf std_msgs/Empty "{}"
