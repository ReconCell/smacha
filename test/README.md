# SMACHA Test Suite

Code for running diff tests to compare code generated by SMACHA to expected SMACH output.

## executive_smach_tutorials

These tests use a slightly modified subtree cloned from the
[executive_smach_tutorials repo](https://github.com/eacousineau/executive_smach_tutorials/tree/hydro-devel).
The code has been superficially refactored in places to make it easier to run diff tests.

### Modifications/Additions

* Class definition ordering, as well as the ordering of other definitions, may have been swapped to suit the recursion of the code generator, etc.
* `service_test.py`: This new test script has been added based on the [SMACH ServiceState tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/smach/Tutorials/ServiceState).
* `GripperSrv.srv`: This new gripper service definition file has been added based on the [SMACH ServiceState tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/smach/Tutorials/ServiceState). The original version of this file was not available online at the time of writing, so this is a "best guess" estimate of what it might have looked like in its original form based on the tutorial.
